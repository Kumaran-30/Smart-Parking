# Smart-Parking
The project involves integrating IoT sensors into public transportation vehicles to monitor ridership, track locations, and predict arrival times. The goal is to provide real-time transit information to the public through a public platform, enhancing the efficiency and quality of public transportation services. Project Objectives: real-time parking space monitoring, mobile app integration, and efficient parking guidance. IoT Sensor Design: design and deployment of IoT sensors in parking spaces to detect occupancy and availability. Real-Time Transit Information Platform: Uses a mobile app interface that displays real-time parking availability to users. Integration Approach: By Determining how Raspberry Pi will collect data from sensors and update the mobile app.
